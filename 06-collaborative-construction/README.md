# Collaborative Construction: Team Practices

## Overview

This directory contains guides on collaborative software development practices, including code reviews, pair programming, team standards, and integration workflows. These practices help teams work together effectively to produce high-quality software.

## Why These Practices Matter

Software development is fundamentally a team activity. Individual brilliance matters less than effective collaboration. Without strong collaborative practices:
- Knowledge silos form around individuals
- Code quality varies wildly across the team
- Integration becomes painful and risky
- Mistakes are caught late or not at all
- Learning happens slowly and inconsistently

With effective collaboration:
- Knowledge spreads across the team
- Code quality is consistently high
- Integration is smooth and frequent
- Problems are caught early
- Everyone learns continuously

## Source Materials

These guides draw from:

- **Code Complete 2** by Steve McConnell (Chapters 20-21, 28-29)
  - Collaborative construction techniques
  - Code reviews and inspections
  - Pair programming
  - Integration strategies
  - Managing construction

- **Clean Code** by Robert C. Martin (Chapter 13)
  - Team rules and standards
  - Clean code at the team level
  - Consistent practices

- **Clean Architecture** by Robert C. Martin
  - Team boundaries and ownership
  - Component-level collaboration

## Key Principles

### Code Review Best Practices
- **Review regularly**: Small, frequent reviews are more effective
- **Be specific**: Point to exact lines and explain concerns
- **Be kind**: Focus on code, not the person
- **Learn from reviews**: Both reviewer and author should learn
- **Use checklists**: Systematic reviews catch more issues

### Pair Programming Benefits
- **Continuous review**: Defects caught immediately
- **Knowledge transfer**: Learning happens naturally
- **Focus**: Fewer distractions, better concentration
- **Design quality**: Two minds produce better solutions
- **Not for everything**: Use strategically for complex/critical code

### Team Standards
- **Document decisions**: Write down and maintain standards
- **Automate enforcement**: Use linters, formatters, CI checks
- **Keep standards minimal**: Only standardize what matters
- **Review standards regularly**: Update as team learns
- **Consistent application**: Standards apply to everyone

### Integration Strategies
- **Integrate frequently**: At least daily, ideally more
- **Small changes**: Smaller integrations are safer
- **Automated testing**: CI runs all tests on every integration
- **Fast feedback**: Failed builds notify immediately
- **Never break the build**: Keep main branch always working

### Agentic Coding (See [07-agentic-coding/](../07-agentic-coding/))
- **Context management**: Understand LLM context windows and fill gaps proactively
- **Strategic parallelization**: Run independent tasks concurrently for time efficiency
- **Context budgeting**: Distribute context across specialized agents
- **Gap analysis**: Use Geist framework to identify and fill context gaps
- **Human-AI collaboration**: Optimize human compute time by providing comprehensive context upfront

## Quick Start Checklist

For code reviews:
- [ ] Review within 24 hours
- [ ] Use review checklist systematically
- [ ] Comment on both good and bad aspects
- [ ] Verify tests exist and pass
- [ ] Check for code smells and violations

For pair programming:
- [ ] Switch driver/navigator every 15-30 minutes
- [ ] Both partners stay engaged
- [ ] Think out loud about decisions
- [ ] Take breaks regularly
- [ ] Rotate pairs to spread knowledge

For integration:
- [ ] Pull latest changes before starting work
- [ ] Integrate at least daily
- [ ] Run full test suite before pushing
- [ ] Fix broken builds immediately
- [ ] Keep changes small and focused

For team standards:
- [ ] Document standards in version control
- [ ] Automate checking where possible
- [ ] Review standards quarterly
- [ ] Apply consistently across team
- [ ] Update based on team retrospectives

For agentic coding (see [07-agentic-coding/](../07-agentic-coding/)):
- [ ] Provide comprehensive context upfront (Geist framework)
- [ ] Fill Ghost/Geyser/Gist context gaps before implementation
- [ ] Monitor for retrieval vs genuine context gaps
- [ ] Limit clarifying questions to 5-10 max (human fatigue threshold)
- [ ] Periodically refresh context every 50-75 turns

# Refactoring Workflow: Safe Code Improvement Process

## Overview

Refactoring is not haphazard code restructuring - it is a disciplined technique for improving code structure while preserving external behavior. The key word is "disciplined." Without a systematic workflow, what starts as refactoring can turn into debugging a broken system.

This guide provides a step-by-step workflow for safely refactoring code. Following this process minimizes risk, maintains productivity, and ensures that improvements actually improve the codebase rather than introducing subtle bugs.

The difference between professional refactoring and dangerous code changes is process. This guide is that process.

## Why Workflow Matters

### The Danger of Undisciplined Refactoring

Without a disciplined workflow, "refactoring" often means:

**Big Bang Changes**: Changing too much at once, losing the ability to identify what broke.

**Lost Behavior**: Accidentally changing what the code does while changing how it does it.

**Compounding Errors**: Making multiple changes before testing, causing errors to pile up and interact.

**Incomplete Refactoring**: Starting changes but not finishing, leaving code in worse state.

**Broken Tests**: Tests fail and you don't know if code broke or tests need updating.

### The Power of Disciplined Refactoring

A systematic workflow provides:

**Safety**: Small steps mean you always know what changed if something breaks.

**Speed**: Counter-intuitively, small tested steps are faster than large risky changes.

**Confidence**: Each step is verified, so you know improvements are real.

**Reversibility**: Small commits mean you can easily back out changes that don't work.

**Team Compatibility**: Others can review and understand small, focused changes.

## The Core Refactoring Workflow

### Step 1: Ensure Tests Exist and Pass

**Never refactor without tests.** This is the cardinal rule.

#### If Tests Exist

```bash
# Run full test suite
pytest tests/

# Check coverage to ensure refactoring target is tested
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html

# Verify tests pass
echo "All tests must pass before refactoring begins"
```

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Full test suite runs
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Coverage includes code you'll refactor
- [ ] Tests run quickly enough to run frequently
- [ ] Tests are independent (can run in any order)

#### If Tests Don't Exist

You must add tests before refactoring. This is non-negotiable.

**Strategy for Legacy Code:**

```python
# Step 1: Characterization test - document current behavior
def test_calculate_discount_current_behavior():
    """
    Characterization test - documents actual behavior.
    TODO: After understanding behavior, improve this test.
    """
    # Test with exact current inputs/outputs
    result = calculate_discount(100, "PREMIUM")
    assert result == 15.5  # Whatever it currently returns

    # Test edge case - what does it do now?
    result = calculate_discount(0, "STANDARD")
    assert result == 0  # Document current behavior

# Step 2: Add comprehensive tests as you understand behavior
def test_calculate_discount_premium_customer():
    """Premium customers get 15% discount"""
    result = calculate_discount(100, "PREMIUM")
    assert result == 15.0

def test_calculate_discount_standard_customer():
    """Standard customers get 5% discount"""
    result = calculate_discount(100, "STANDARD")
    assert result == 5.0
```

**Adding Tests Safely:**

1. **Write Characterization Tests**: Document what code currently does
2. **Find Seams**: Identify where you can add tests without changing code
3. **Break Dependencies**: Make code testable (this might require careful refactoring)
4. **Add Comprehensive Tests**: Once testable, add proper test coverage
5. **Begin Refactoring**: Now you have safety net

**Example - Breaking Dependencies:**

```typescript
// Before - hard to test due to tight coupling
class OrderProcessor {
  processOrder(order: Order): void {
    // Tightly coupled to EmailService
    const emailService = new EmailService();
    emailService.send(order.customer.email, "Order confirmed");

    // Tightly coupled to Database
    const db = new Database("prod-connection-string");
    db.save(order);
  }
}

// After - testable through dependency injection
class OrderProcessor {
  constructor(
    private emailService: EmailService,
    private database: Database
  ) {}

  processOrder(order: Order): void {
    this.emailService.send(order.customer.email, "Order confirmed");
    this.database.save(order);
  }
}

// Now we can test with mocks
describe('OrderProcessor', () => {
  it('should send confirmation email', () => {
    const mockEmail = createMock<EmailService>();
    const mockDb = createMock<Database>();
    const processor = new OrderProcessor(mockEmail, mockDb);

    processor.processOrder(testOrder);

    expect(mockEmail.send).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
      testOrder.customer.email,
      "Order confirmed"
    );
  });
});
```

### Step 2: Identify the Code Smell

Be specific about what's wrong. Vague "this code is bad" doesn't help. Use the catalog of code smells.

**Good Smell Identification:**
- "This method is 150 lines long" (Long Method)
- "This method takes 7 parameters" (Too Many Arguments)
- "This conditional switches on object type" (Replace Conditional with Polymorphism)
- "This code appears in 3 places" (Duplicated Code)

**Poor Smell Identification:**
- "This code is messy"
- "I don't like this"
- "This could be better"

**Documentation Template:**

```markdown
## Refactoring Plan

**File**: src/services/order_processor.py
**Function**: process_order()

**Code Smell**: Long Method (150 lines)

**Specific Issues**:
- Lines 10-40: Validation logic
- Lines 41-80: Price calculation
- Lines 81-120: Database persistence
- Lines 121-150: Email notification

**Impact**: Difficult to understand, test, and maintain

**Related Smells**: Also has Too Many Arguments (8 parameters)
```

### Step 3: Select Appropriate Refactoring

Match the smell to the refactoring technique. Consult the refactoring catalog.

**Common Mappings:**

| Smell | Refactoring |
|-------|-------------|
| Long Method | Extract Method |
| Too Many Arguments | Introduce Parameter Object |
| Duplicated Code | Extract Method, Pull Up Method |
| Large Class | Extract Class |
| Long Parameter List | Introduce Parameter Object |
| Divergent Change | Extract Class |
| Feature Envy | Move Method |
| Data Clumps | Extract Class |
| Primitive Obsession | Replace Data Value with Object |
| Switch Statements | Replace Conditional with Polymorphism |

**Plan the Refactoring:**

```python
# BEFORE (150 lines)
def process_order(customer_name, customer_email, item1_name, item1_price,
                 item2_name, item2_price, shipping_address, payment_method):
    # Validation (30 lines)
    # ...

    # Calculation (40 lines)
    # ...

    # Persistence (40 lines)
    # ...

    # Notification (40 lines)
    # ...

# REFACTORING PLAN:
# Step 1: Extract Method for validation -> validate_order()
# Step 2: Extract Method for calculation -> calculate_total()
# Step 3: Extract Method for persistence -> save_order()
# Step 4: Extract Method for notification -> notify_customer()
# Step 5: Introduce Parameter Object -> OrderRequest class
# Step 6: Final cleanup and test

# AFTER (10 lines)
def process_order(order_request: OrderRequest) -> Order:
    validate_order(order_request)
    total = calculate_total(order_request)
    order = save_order(order_request, total)
    notify_customer(order)
    return order
```

### Step 4: Make Small Changes

**Cardinal Rule: Make the smallest change possible, then test.**

Break large refactorings into tiny steps. Each step should take 1-5 minutes.

**Example: Extract Method Refactoring**

```java
// STEP 0: All tests passing (baseline)

// Original code
public void printInvoice(Invoice invoice) {
    System.out.println("Invoice for: " + invoice.getCustomer());
    double total = 0;
    for (Item item : invoice.getItems()) {
        double amount = item.getPrice() * item.getQuantity();
        total += amount;
        System.out.println(item.getName() + ": " + amount);
    }
    System.out.println("Total: " + total);
}

// STEP 1: Extract printHeader
public void printInvoice(Invoice invoice) {
    printHeader(invoice);  // <-- Extracted
    double total = 0;
    for (Item item : invoice.getItems()) {
        double amount = item.getPrice() * item.getQuantity();
        total += amount;
        System.out.println(item.getName() + ": " + amount);
    }
    System.out.println("Total: " + total);
}

private void printHeader(Invoice invoice) {
    System.out.println("Invoice for: " + invoice.getCustomer());
}

// Run tests - should still pass
// Commit: "refactor: extract printHeader method"

// STEP 2: Extract calculateAmount
public void printInvoice(Invoice invoice) {
    printHeader(invoice);
    double total = 0;
    for (Item item : invoice.getItems()) {
        double amount = calculateAmount(item);  // <-- Extracted
        total += amount;
        System.out.println(item.getName() + ": " + amount);
    }
    System.out.println("Total: " + total);
}

private double calculateAmount(Item item) {
    return item.getPrice() * item.getQuantity();
}

// Run tests - should still pass
// Commit: "refactor: extract calculateAmount method"

// STEP 3: Extract printLineItems
public void printInvoice(Invoice invoice) {
    printHeader(invoice);
    double total = printLineItems(invoice.getItems());  // <-- Extracted
    System.out.println("Total: " + total);
}

private double printLineItems(List<Item> items) {
    double total = 0;
    for (Item item : items) {
        double amount = calculateAmount(item);
        total += amount;
        System.out.println(item.getName() + ": " + amount);
    }
    return total;
}

// Run tests - should still pass
// Commit: "refactor: extract printLineItems method"

// STEP 4: Extract printTotal
public void printInvoice(Invoice invoice) {
    printHeader(invoice);
    double total = printLineItems(invoice.getItems());
    printTotal(total);  // <-- Extracted
}

private void printTotal(double total) {
    System.out.println("Total: " + total);
}

// Run tests - should still pass
// Commit: "refactor: extract printTotal method"

// FINAL: Clean, tested, committed
```

**Why Small Steps Matter:**

```
Large Change Approach:
Make 10 changes -> Run tests -> 5 tests fail
Now what? Which change broke which test?
Result: 30 minutes debugging

Small Step Approach:
Make 1 change -> Run tests -> Pass -> Commit
Make 1 change -> Run tests -> Fail -> Undo
Fix approach -> Run tests -> Pass -> Commit
Make 1 change -> Run tests -> Pass -> Commit
...
Result: 10 minutes, no debugging
```

### Step 5: Run Tests After Each Change

**After every single refactoring step, run tests.**

```bash
# Ideal workflow (with fast tests)
# Edit code
pytest tests/test_order_processor.py -v

# If tests pass
git add src/order_processor.py
git commit -m "refactor: extract validation method"

# If tests fail
git diff  # Review what changed
git checkout .  # Undo and try different approach
```

**Test Running Strategies:**

**Fast Tests (<1 second):** Run full suite after every change
**Medium Tests (1-10 seconds):** Run affected tests after each change, full suite before commit
**Slow Tests (>10 seconds):** Run affected tests frequently, full suite before push

**Automated Test Running:**

```bash
# Use watch mode for continuous testing
pytest-watch tests/ -- -v

# Or use IDE integrated test runner
# Run tests on file save (most IDEs support this)
```

### Step 6: Commit Frequently

**Commit after each successful refactoring step.**

**Commit Message Format:**

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "refactor: extract validation into separate method"
git commit -m "refactor: introduce OrderRequest parameter object"
git commit -m "refactor: rename confusing variable customerData to customer"

# Poor commit messages
git commit -m "refactoring"
git commit -m "WIP"
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
```

**Commit Granularity:**

```
Too Coarse (Bad):
- Commit 1: "refactored order processing" (50 files changed)

Too Fine (Excessive):
- Commit 1: "renamed variable x to customerName"
- Commit 2: "renamed variable y to orderTotal"
- Commit 3: "renamed variable z to itemCount"

Just Right (Good):
- Commit 1: "refactor: extract order validation method"
- Commit 2: "refactor: extract total calculation method"
- Commit 3: "refactor: introduce OrderRequest parameter object"
```

**Why Frequent Commits Matter:**

```python
# Scenario: You're 5 refactorings in and tests fail

# With frequent commits:
git log --oneline
# abc123 refactor: introduce parameter object
# def456 refactor: extract calculate_total
# ghi789 refactor: extract validate_order
# jkl012 refactor: extract save_order

# Easy to identify problem
git revert abc123  # Undo last change
# Tests pass again - know exactly what caused issue

# Without commits:
# Made 5 changes, tests fail somewhere
# Must undo all changes or manually debug
# 30+ minutes lost
```

### Step 7: Review and Clean Up

After refactoring works, do final review:

**Code Review Checklist:**

```markdown
## Post-Refactoring Review

### Functionality
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Behavior unchanged from original
- [ ] Edge cases still handled correctly
- [ ] Performance not degraded

### Code Quality
- [ ] Names are clear and intention-revealing
- [ ] Functions are small and focused
- [ ] No new code smells introduced
- [ ] Abstraction level is consistent
- [ ] No over-engineering or speculation

### Testing
- [ ] Test coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] Tests still meaningful (not just testing implementation)
- [ ] Fast tests are still fast
- [ ] No ignored or skipped tests

### Documentation
- [ ] Comments updated if needed
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] README updated if public interface changed
- [ ] Migration notes if breaking changes

### Team Impact
- [ ] Changes are reviewable
- [ ] Commit history tells the story
- [ ] No merge conflicts created
- [ ] Team aware of significant changes
```

**Final Cleanup:**

```typescript
// Before final commit, check for:

// 1. Unused imports
import { calculateTotal } from './calculator';  // Still used?
import { validateOrder } from './validator';    // Still used?

// 2. Commented-out code
// function oldCalculation() {
//   // This was replaced - delete it
// }

// 3. Debug statements
console.log("DEBUG: order total", total);  // Remove
debugger;  // Remove

// 4. Temporary variables
const temp = processOrder();  // Rename to something meaningful

// 5. Inconsistent formatting
function processOrder( order:Order ):void{  // Format consistently
    // ...
}
```

## Advanced Refactoring Scenarios

### Refactoring Without Breaking API

When refactoring public APIs, maintain backward compatibility during transition.

**Strategy: Parallel Implementation**

```python
# Step 1: Add new API alongside old
class UserService:
    def get_user(self, user_id: int) -> User:
        """Old API - DEPRECATED, use get_user_by_id"""
        return self.get_user_by_id(user_id)

    def get_user_by_id(self, user_id: int) -> User:
        """New API - preferred method"""
        # New implementation
        return self.repository.find_by_id(user_id)

# Step 2: Migrate callers gradually
# Old code (still works)
user = service.get_user(123)

# New code (preferred)
user = service.get_user_by_id(123)

# Step 3: After all callers migrated, remove old API
class UserService:
    def get_user_by_id(self, user_id: int) -> User:
        """Retrieve user by ID"""
        return self.repository.find_by_id(user_id)
```

### Refactoring Large Classes

**Strategy: Gradual Extraction**

```java
// Original: 1000-line God Class
public class OrderProcessor {
    // Validation methods (200 lines)
    // Calculation methods (300 lines)
    // Database methods (200 lines)
    // Email methods (100 lines)
    // Logging methods (100 lines)
    // Utility methods (100 lines)
}

// Step 1: Extract validation to separate class
public class OrderProcessor {
    private OrderValidator validator = new OrderValidator();

    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        validator.validate(order);  // Delegated
        // ... rest of processing
    }
}

public class OrderValidator {
    // 200 lines of validation logic moved here
}

// Step 2: Extract calculation
public class OrderProcessor {
    private OrderValidator validator = new OrderValidator();
    private OrderCalculator calculator = new OrderCalculator();

    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        validator.validate(order);
        double total = calculator.calculateTotal(order);  // Delegated
        // ... rest of processing
    }
}

// Step 3: Continue extracting until OrderProcessor is coordinator
public class OrderProcessor {
    private OrderValidator validator;
    private OrderCalculator calculator;
    private OrderRepository repository;
    private NotificationService notifier;

    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        validator.validate(order);
        double total = calculator.calculateTotal(order);
        Order saved = repository.save(order.withTotal(total));
        notifier.sendConfirmation(saved);
    }
}

// Now OrderProcessor is 20 lines, high-level orchestration
```

### Refactoring in Team Environment

**Strategy: Branch-Based Refactoring**

```bash
# Create refactoring branch
git checkout -b refactor/extract-order-validation

# Make small commits
git commit -m "refactor: extract validation method"
git commit -m "refactor: move validation to separate class"
git commit -m "refactor: add tests for OrderValidator"

# Keep branch updated with main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Create pull request with clear description
# Title: "Refactor: Extract order validation into separate class"
# Description:
# - Extracted 200 lines of validation logic
# - Created OrderValidator class
# - All tests passing
# - No behavior changes
# - Coverage maintained at 85%
```

**Team Communication:**

```markdown
## Pull Request: Extract Order Validation

### Motivation
OrderProcessor was 1000 lines. First step in breaking it down.

### Changes
- Created OrderValidator class
- Moved validation logic from OrderProcessor
- Updated tests to cover both classes
- No behavior changes

### Testing
- All existing tests pass
- Added 5 new tests for OrderValidator
- Coverage: 87% (up from 85%)

### Review Focus
- Validation logic correctly extracted?
- Any edge cases missed?
- Tests comprehensive enough?

### Migration
No migration needed - internal refactoring only.
Public API unchanged.
```

### Refactoring Under Time Pressure

When you need to add a feature but code needs refactoring first.

**Strategy: Targeted Refactoring**

```python
# Scenario: Need to add new discount type to messy code

# DON'T: Refactor everything (takes days)
# DON'T: Add feature to messy code (makes it worse)
# DO: Refactor just enough to add feature cleanly

# Step 1: Identify minimum refactoring needed
def calculate_price(item, customer_type, quantity):
    # 100 lines of messy calculation logic
    # Need to add new customer_type "CORPORATE"
    # Can't understand this code well enough to modify safely

# Step 2: Add tests for current behavior (if missing)
def test_premium_customer_pricing():
    assert calculate_price(item, "PREMIUM", 10) == 95.0

def test_standard_customer_pricing():
    assert calculate_price(item, "STANDARD", 10) == 100.0

# Step 3: Refactor just enough to make feature easy
# Extract the customer-specific logic
def calculate_price(item, customer_type, quantity):
    base_price = item.price * quantity
    discount = get_customer_discount(customer_type)
    return base_price * (1 - discount)

def get_customer_discount(customer_type):
    discounts = {
        "PREMIUM": 0.15,
        "STANDARD": 0.05
    }
    return discounts.get(customer_type, 0)

# Step 4: Now adding feature is trivial
def get_customer_discount(customer_type):
    discounts = {
        "PREMIUM": 0.15,
        "STANDARD": 0.05,
        "CORPORATE": 0.20  # <-- Easy addition
    }
    return discounts.get(customer_type, 0)

# Step 5: Schedule follow-up refactoring if needed
# TODO: Further refactoring - extract pricing strategy pattern
```

## Common Refactoring Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Refactoring Without Tests

**Problem:**
```python
# No tests exist
def complex_calculation(data):
    # 100 lines of undocumented logic
    return result

# Start refactoring anyway
# Break something subtle
# Have no way to know
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Add characterization tests first
def test_complex_calculation_existing_behavior():
    """Document current behavior before refactoring"""
    # Test with real inputs from production logs
    result = complex_calculation(production_data_sample_1)
    assert result == 42.5  # Whatever it currently returns

    result = complex_calculation(production_data_sample_2)
    assert result == 17.3

# Now refactor safely
```

### Pitfall 2: Too Many Changes at Once

**Problem:**
```bash
git diff
# 50 files changed, 2000+ lines changed
# Refactored 10 classes, renamed 30 methods, changed architecture
# Tests fail in mysterious ways
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make one refactoring per commit
git log --oneline
abc123 refactor: extract UserValidator class
def456 refactor: rename getUserData to getUser
ghi789 refactor: introduce UserRepository interface

# Each commit is small, focused, tested
```

### Pitfall 3: Changing Behavior During Refactoring

**Problem:**
```typescript
// Original (has subtle bug but matches tests)
function calculateDiscount(price: number, isPreferred: boolean): number {
  if (isPreferred) {
    return price * 0.1;  // Bug: should be 0.15
  }
  return 0;
}

// Refactoring that "fixes" bug
function calculateDiscount(price: number, isPreferred: boolean): number {
  const PREFERRED_DISCOUNT = 0.15;  // Fixed bug during refactoring!
  if (isPreferred) {
    return price * PREFERRED_DISCOUNT;
  }
  return 0;
}

// Problem: Tests now fail, but is it refactoring bug or fixing existing bug?
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Step 1: Refactor without changing behavior
function calculateDiscount(price: number, isPreferred: boolean): number {
  const PREFERRED_DISCOUNT = 0.1;  // Keep existing (wrong) value
  if (isPreferred) {
    return price * PREFERRED_DISCOUNT;
  }
  return 0;
}
// Commit: "refactor: extract discount constant"

// Step 2: Separate commit to fix bug
function calculateDiscount(price: number, isPreferred: boolean): number {
  const PREFERRED_DISCOUNT = 0.15;  // Now fix the bug
  if (isPreferred) {
    return price * PREFERRED_DISCOUNT;
  }
  return 0;
}
// Commit: "fix: correct preferred customer discount rate"
```

### Pitfall 4: Premature Abstraction

**Problem:**
```java
// Seeing duplication in 2 places
public void processUserOrder(User user) {
    double total = user.getCart().getTotal();
    user.charge(total);
}

public void processGuestOrder(Guest guest) {
    double total = guest.getCart().getTotal();
    guest.charge(total);
}

// Immediately abstracting
public interface Chargeable {
    Cart getCart();
    void charge(double amount);
}

// Now stuck with awkward abstraction as system evolves
```

**Solution:**
```java
// Rule of Three: Wait for third occurrence
// Keep duplication in 2 places
// When third appears, then abstract
// You'll have better understanding of right abstraction
```

### Pitfall 5: Refactoring Without Business Value

**Problem:**
```python
# Spending 2 weeks refactoring code that:
# - Rarely changes
# - Works correctly
# - Nobody complains about
# Meanwhile, customer-facing bugs go unfixed
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Apply Boy Scout Rule instead:
# When you touch code, leave it slightly better
# Focus refactoring effort on:
# - Code you're actively changing
# - Code causing bugs
# - Code blocking new features
# - Code developers complain about
```

## Refactoring Decision Framework

### Should I Refactor This Code?

**Yes, Refactor If:**
- [ ] You're about to change it (preparatory refactoring)
- [ ] It's causing bugs
- [ ] It's blocking new features
- [ ] You have tests or can add them
- [ ] Team agrees it's a problem
- [ ] Risk is manageable

**No, Don't Refactor If:**
- [ ] Code is stable and rarely changes
- [ ] No tests and code is too complex to test
- [ ] About to be replaced/deleted
- [ ] Team lacks domain knowledge
- [ ] Time pressure is severe
- [ ] Business value is unclear

**Maybe, Refactor Later If:**
- [ ] Would like to improve but not urgent
- [ ] Need to learn domain first
- [ ] Need to add tests first
- [ ] Other priorities are higher

### When to Refactor vs. Rewrite

**Refactor When:**
- Tests exist
- Behavior is well-understood
- Changes are localized
- Can be done incrementally
- Team understands codebase

**Rewrite When:**
- No tests and impossible to add
- Architecture is fundamentally broken
- Technology is obsolete
- Cost of refactoring exceeds rewrite
- Starting fresh is clearer path

## Summary

Safe refactoring is all about discipline and process:

**Key Principles:**

1. **Never refactor without tests** - This is non-negotiable
2. **Make tiny changes** - Smaller than you think necessary
3. **Run tests constantly** - After every single change
4. **Commit frequently** - Create safety checkpoints
5. **Preserve behavior** - Fix bugs separately from refactoring
6. **Stay focused** - One smell, one refactoring at a time
7. **Review and clean** - Final pass ensures quality

**The Refactoring Rhythm:**

```
Edit -> Test -> Commit
Edit -> Test -> Commit
Edit -> Test -> Commit
...
```

This rhythm becomes automatic with practice. You'll find yourself naturally making smaller changes and testing more frequently. The result is faster, safer improvements that actually improve the codebase rather than breaking it.

**Remember:** Professional refactoring is not about being clever or making dramatic changes. It's about being disciplined, systematic, and safe. Small steps, frequently tested, regularly committed. That's the path to sustainable code improvement.

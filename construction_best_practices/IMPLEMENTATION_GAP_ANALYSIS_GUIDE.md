## üìã Overview

**Purpose**: Provide a systematic framework for conducting implementation gap analysis to ensure all planned features are properly implemented and identify areas requiring future work.

**When to Use**:

- After completing any implementation following a MARKDOWN_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md
- Before final commit and deployment
- During handoff to next developer
- When resuming work on partially implemented features

**Success Criteria**:

- Complete mapping of planned vs. actual implementation
- Clear documentation of implementation gaps
- Prioritized next steps for gap closure
- Quality assurance validation completed

## üéØ Gap Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Coverage Analysis (30 minutes)

#### 1.1 Functional Requirements Review

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Extract all functional requirements from original implementation plan
- [ ] Map each requirement to actual implemented code/features
- [ ] Identify completely implemented, partially implemented, and missing requirements
- [ ] Document any requirements that changed during implementation
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Identify all TODO comments and mock data usage
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Verify all hardcoded values replaced with production implementations

**Enhanced Analysis Commands**:

```bash
# Comprehensive TODO and implementation gap detection
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX\|mock\|Mock\|placeholder\|hardcoded" src/ --include="*.py" | sort
find src/ -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "test.*data\|demo.*data\|sample.*data" {} \;

# Token workflow specific analysis
grep -r "ResumeTokenService\|resume_token\|secure_token" src/ --include="*.py"
grep -r "thread_id.*hardcoded\|assistant_id.*hardcoded" src/ --include="*.py"

# Database integration completeness
grep -r "database.*mock\|mock.*database" src/ --include="*.py"
grep -r "fallback.*storage\|storage.*fallback" src/ --include="*.py"
```

**Template**:

```markdown

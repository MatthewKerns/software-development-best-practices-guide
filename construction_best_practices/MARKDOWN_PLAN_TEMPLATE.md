## üß™ Test-Driven Development Approach

### Test Strategy

**üìñ Reference**: [`construction_best_practices/TDD_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`](construction_best_practices/TDD_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)

1. **Test Categories**:

   - [ ] Unit tests (@pytest.mark.unit)
   - [ ] Node tests (@pytest.mark.node) - if LangGraph components
   - [ ] Integration tests (@pytest.mark.integration)
   - [ ] End-to-end tests (@pytest.mark.e2e) - if applicable

2. **Test Development Process**:
   - [ ] Write failing tests FIRST that capture acceptance criteria
   - [ ] Write comments-first pseudocode design
   - [ ] Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - [ ] Refactor with green tests

### Coverage Requirements

```bash
# Target coverage validation commands
pytest -m "unit or node" -q --cov=src --cov-fail-under=85
pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=85 --cov-report=html
```

## üìä Quality Assurance & Validation

### Code Quality Checklist

**Pre-Implementation**:

- [ ] README.md consulted for business context
- [ ] README created/updated for new modules or significant changes
- [ ] Appropriate guides referenced (TDD, Commenting, Testing, Architecture, etc.)

**During Implementation**:

- [ ] Comments-first pseudocode completed before coding
- [ ] Defensive programming practices applied
- [ ] Input validation and error handling implemented
- [ ] Variable names follow self-explanatory naming standards
- [ ] String operations follow constants and validation standards
- [ ] Backwards compatibility: not required

**Post-Implementation**:

- [ ] Remove old implementations and unit tests whose functionality we are
      replacing (if it applies for this task)
- [ ] All tests pass with appropriate markers (we should make sure as many tests pass as possible, and not use skip markers as much as possible - this ensures complete coverage with maximizes our chances that the code commit will not break the workflow execution)
- [ ] Business logic comments explain "why" decisions were made
- [ ] All public functions have comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Coverage maintained or improved (‚â•85%)
- [ ] No duplicate files created
- [ ] Development files properly organized
- [ ] References updated after any file moves
- [ ] Root directory kept clean

### Implementation Gap Analysis

**Critical Final Step**: Before finalizing the commit, conduct a comprehensive analysis of plan vs. actual implementation to identify any remaining gaps.

**Gap Analysis Process**:

1. **Requirements Review**:

   - [ ] Compare implemented features against all functional requirements
   - [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria have been met
   - [ ] Check that all planned phases/tasks were completed

2. **Integration Assessment**:

   - [ ] Verify all planned integrations are functional end-to-end
   - [ ] Confirm all API endpoints are properly mounted and accessible
   - [ ] Test all workflow connections and data flow paths

3. **Testing Coverage Analysis**:

   - [ ] Ensure all new/modified components have corresponding tests
   - [ ] Verify integration tests cover all planned integration points
   - [ ] Confirm end-to-end tests validate complete user workflows

4. **üö® Mock Implementation Detection (CRITICAL)**:

   - [ ] Search for mock/placeholder patterns in implementation
   - [ ] Verify all API endpoints have real business logic (not just success responses)
   - [ ] Check that external integrations actually connect to real services
   - [ ] Confirm database operations persist/retrieve actual data
   - [ ] Validate workflow steps perform intended business logic

   **Detection Commands**:

   ```bash
   grep -r "mock\|placeholder\|TODO\|FIXME" src/ --include="*.py"
   grep -r "return {}\|return \[\]\|return.*success.*true" src/ --include="*.py"
   ```

5. **Documentation Gap Check**:
   - [ ] All planned documentation updates completed
   - [ ] No broken cross-references or outdated information
   - [ ] Business context documented for future maintainers

**Gap Documentation**:

```markdown
## Implementation Status Assessment

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented

- [List completed requirements with brief validation notes]

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented

- [List partially completed items with specific gaps identified]

### ‚ùå Not Implemented

- [List unimplemented requirements with reasons/blockers]

### ÔøΩ Mock Implementations Found

- **API Endpoints**: [List endpoints with mock responses]
- **Service Methods**: [List service methods with placeholder logic]
- **Integration Points**: [List external integrations not fully implemented]
- **Database Operations**: [List DB operations that don't persist real data]
- **Workflow Steps**: [List LangGraph nodes with placeholder logic]

### ÔøΩüîÑ Next Steps Required

- [Prioritized list of remaining work for future implementation]

### üß™ Validation Results

- [Summary of test results and any test gaps]
- [End-to-end workflow validation status]
```

**Handoff Requirements**:

- [ ] Clear documentation of implementation gaps for next developer
- [ ] Prioritized next steps with estimated effort
- [ ] Any blocking issues or dependencies identified
- [ ] Complete status summary for project stakeholders

### Integration Validation

- [ ] Branch organization - merge all separated commits created during development into one commit with one final commit message using git reset --soft

```bash
# Complete validation sequence
./dev-tools/scripts/prepare-commit.sh --skip-rebase

# Individual validation commands
black . && isort . && ruff check . && mypy src/
pytest -m "unit or node" -x -q --cov=src --cov-fail-under=85
pytest -m "not live" -v
```

### Server Startup Validation

**Critical Requirement**: Confirm server starts up successfully after all changes

```bash
# LangGraph server startup test
cd /path/to/project
source .venv/bin/activate
langgraph dev

# Expected: Server starts without critical errors
# Expected: Port binding successful
# Expected: Health endpoint responds
# Expected: No immediate crashes or exceptions
```

### Complete Workflow Testing

**Requirement**: Verify each node and component of the workflow executes successfully all the way through to the end of the workflow.

**Use existing testing tools and update as needed to ensure complete workflow execution:**

```bash
# Quick workflow validation (recommended for most implementations)
python dev-tools/scripts/testing/test-workflow.py --json

# Comprehensive end-to-end testing with multiple scenarios
python dev-tools/scripts/testing/test-langgraph-client.py --test-type full

# Automated testing with server startup and cleanup
./dev-tools/scripts/testing/quick-test-langgraph.sh empty

# Integration testing via pytest for workflow components
pytest tests/integration_tests/human_review/test_complete_workflow.py -v
```

**Success Criteria**:

- [ ] Workflow completes without errors (`status: "success"`)
- [ ] All workflow nodes execute successfully
- [ ] Test reaches the final workflow state
- [ ] No unhandled exceptions or interrupts
- [ ] Integration tests pass with proper component interaction

**Validation Process**:

1. [ ] Send test request using existing tools
2. [ ] Identify and fix any errors that prevent completion
3. [ ] Update node integration tests as needed for new/modified components
4. [ ] Repeat until complete workflow execution is verified

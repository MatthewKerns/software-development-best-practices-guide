# Software Development Best Practices Guide

**A comprehensive, project-agnostic guide synthesizing principles from Code Complete 2, Clean Code, and Clean Architecture**

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository provides battle-tested software development best practices organized into a clear, progressive learning path. Whether you're writing your first function or architecting a complex system, these guides offer practical, actionable advice grounded in industry-standard books and real-world experience.

### Core Philosophy

- **Foundations First**: Master the basics before tackling advanced concepts
- **Practical Over Theoretical**: Every guide includes real code examples and checklists
- **Multi-Language Support**: Examples in Python, TypeScript, and Java
- **Progressive Learning**: Organized from fundamental skills to advanced techniques

### Source Materials

Our guides synthesize principles from three foundational books:
- **Code Complete 2** by Steve McConnell - Construction-focused, research-backed coding practices
- **Clean Code** by Robert C. Martin - Readability and maintainability principles
- **Clean Architecture** by Robert C. Martin - System design and architectural patterns

## 💡 How to Use This Repository

### Daily Coding

Keep 01-foundations/ guides handy:
- Check VARIABLE_NAMING.md when naming is unclear
- Reference FUNCTIONS_AND_ROUTINES.md before writing complex functions
- Consult ERROR_HANDLING.md when implementing error handling

### Code Reviews

Use guides as review checklists:
- Compare code against foundation principles
- Check for anti-patterns described in guides
- Suggest improvements from specific guide sections

### For AI Agents (Claude Code / GitHub Copilot)

These files are designed to be read by AI coding agents:

- **Claude Code**: Reads `CLAUDE.md` from project root automatically

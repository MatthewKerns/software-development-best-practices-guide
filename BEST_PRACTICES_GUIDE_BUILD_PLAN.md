# Comprehensive Best Practices Guide Build Plan
**Integrating Code Complete 2, Clean Code, and Clean Architecture**

---

## 📋 Overview

**Objective**: Transform the current best practices repository into a comprehensive, battle-tested guide that synthesizes principles from three foundational software engineering books:

1. **Code Complete 2** by Steve McConnell - Construction-focused, practical coding excellence
2. **Clean Code** by Robert C. Martin - Code readability and maintainability
3. **Clean Architecture** by Robert C. Martin - System design and architectural principles

**Philosophy**: These guides should work synergistically with the existing **Geist Framework** (Ghost/Geyser/Gist), creating a unified approach to software excellence.

### Unified Development Workflow

```
1. GEIST ANALYSIS (Philosophy)
   ↓ Ghost: What don't I know?
   ↓ Geyser: How will this grow?
   ↓ Gist: What's essential?

2. CLEAN ARCHITECTURE (Structure)
   ↓ SOLID principles guide design
   ↓ Components and boundaries defined
   ↓ Dependency rule enforced

3. CODE COMPLETE 2 (Construction)
   ↓ Pseudocode design
   ↓ Defensive programming
   ↓ Routine-level quality

4. CLEAN CODE (Craftsmanship)
   ↓ Meaningful names
   ↓ Small functions
   ↓ Self-documenting code

5. TESTING & REFACTORING (Quality)
   ↓ TDD workflow
   ↓ Code smell detection
   ↓ Continuous improvement
```

4. **Iterate** - Refine the structure based on first few guides
5. **Build momentum** - Complete one guide per day target

---

## 📖 How to Contribute to This Effort

If you have access to the three books, you can:

1. **Extract Key Principles** - Create bullet-point summaries of chapters
2. **Provide Examples** - Share generic code examples that illustrate concepts
3. **Review Drafts** - Validate that guides accurately represent the books
4. **Suggest Structure** - Improve the organization and flow

**Note**: All content must be original writing based on understood principles, not copied text from copyrighted sources.

---

**Remember: This guide structure transforms three foundational books into an integrated, actionable system enhanced by the Geist framework's philosophical depth. The result is a comprehensive software development best practices guide that is both principled and pragmatic.**

## 🆕 Roadmap Additions (beyond the original three-books scope)

### `stakeholder-communications` skill + `06-collaborative-construction/STAKEHOLDER_COMMUNICATIONS.md`

**Why**: We generate client/stakeholder-facing updates (e.g. Slack notes, briefs, test asks to Trevor on IDEA Brand Coach). There is currently no guide section or skill governing *external* communication discipline — `06-collaborative-construction` only covers internal team practices (reviews, pair programming, working-with-agents).

**Governing rule (the reason this was raised)** — **verify-before-ask gate**: never ask an external stakeholder to test, verify, or re-walk something the agent/author has not first verified end-to-end themselves. No "please try X and confirm" for unexercised behaviour. Verify → report only what's confirmed → if you can't verify, say so plainly rather than outsourcing the first check.

**Scope for the skill/doc**:
- The verify-before-ask gate (above) as the hard rule.
- Update anatomy: what was done, what was *verified* (and how), what's genuinely left for the stakeholder, explicit confidence/unknowns.
- Honesty over reassurance — don't claim a fix works without evidence.
- Tone/format templates per channel (Slack, email, brief).

**Status**: ROADMAP — captured 2026-07-09. Interim enforcement lives in the IDEA Brand Coach `AGENTS.md` ("Never Do") until the shared skill exists; migrate that rule here when built so it applies across all projects.

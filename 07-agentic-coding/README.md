# Agentic Coding: Collaborative Development with AI

**Purpose:** Comprehensive guide to working effectively with AI coding assistants (LLMs) in software development

**Scope:** Context management, communication strategies, optimization techniques, and best practices for human-AI collaboration

---

## Overview

Agentic coding represents a paradigm shift in software development: humans and AI working as collaborative partners rather than developer using tool. Success requires understanding how LLMs process information, manage context, and produce code.

**Key Principle:** The most productive use of human time is often filling context gaps, not writing code.

## Guide Structure

### 1. Context Fundamentals
Understanding the foundation of how LLMs work and why context matters.

- **[What is an LLM](context/WHAT_IS_AN_LLM.md)** - Large Language Models explained for developers
- **[What is Context](context/WHAT_IS_CONTEXT.md)** - Context windows, tokens, and information retrieval
- **[Why Context Matters](context/WHY_CONTEXT_MATTERS.md)** - Impact of context on code quality and correctness
- **[Context Limits](context/CONTEXT_LIMITS.md)** - Understanding constraints and boundaries

#### Deep Dive: Context Gaps
- **[LLM Knowledge Boundaries](context/LLM_KNOWLEDGE_BOUNDARIES.md)** - What LLMs can retrieve vs what they need to be told
- **[Context Gap Investigation](context/CONTEXT_GAP_INVESTIGATION.md)** - Should you ask the LLM to identify its own context gaps?
- **[Evolving LLM Capabilities](context/EVOLVING_CAPABILITIES.md)** - How context limits change as LLMs improve

### 2. Context Filling Strategies
Practical techniques for providing the right information efficiently.

- **[Problem Identification First](context-filling-strategies/PROBLEM_IDENTIFICATION_FIRST.md)** - Know the problem before solving it
- **[Efficient Context Transfer](context-filling-strategies/EFFICIENT_CONTEXT_TRANSFER.md)** - Best practices for filling context
- **[Clarifying Questions Protocol](context-filling-strategies/CLARIFYING_QUESTIONS_PROTOCOL.md)** - Asking and answering questions effectively (human limit: 5-10 questions before disengagement)
- **[Context Prioritization](context-filling-strategies/CONTEXT_PRIORITIZATION.md)** - What to fill first, what can wait
- **[Geist Gap Analysis Framework](context-filling-strategies/GEIST_GAP_ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md)** - Systematic three-dimensional context gap analysis (Ghost/Geyser/Gist)

### 3. Optimization & Collaboration
Advanced patterns for maximizing effectiveness of human-AI collaboration.

- **[Context Window Optimization](optimization/CONTEXT_WINDOW_OPTIMIZATION.md)** - Managing context budgets (comprehensive guide at [AGENTIC_CODING_OPTIMIZATION.md](optimization/AGENTIC_CODING_OPTIMIZATION.md))
- **[Parallel Execution Patterns](optimization/PARALLEL_EXECUTION_PATTERNS.md)** - Strategic parallelization for time efficiency
- **[Human Compute Time Optimization](optimization/HUMAN_COMPUTE_TIME_OPTIMIZATION.md)** - Where humans add the most value

## Core Insights

### The Context Paradox
> "It sucks to fill context, but this often is the most productive thing we can do with our human brain compute time."

**Why this matters:**
- AI can write code in seconds
- AI cannot guess missing requirements, architecture decisions, or business context
- Human time spent clarifying context = AI produces correct code first try
- Human time saved debugging wrong implementations = exponential productivity gains

### The Problem Identification Principle
> "The best way to fill the most relevant context efficiently is to KNOW THE PROBLEM you are solving."

**Implementation:**
1. **Identify the correct problem** (often takes significant time, but can be optimized)
2. **Understand it as much as possible** (research, ask questions, gather requirements)
3. **Pick up context from multiple sources** (existing code, docs, stakeholders)
4. **Provide comprehensive context to AI** (reduces back-and-forth)

### Human Cognitive Limits in Agentic Coding

**Question Fatigue Threshold:** 5-10 clarifying questions
- Beyond 10 questions: Human engagement drops
- Developer may walk away, context lost
- Next session requires re-filling context

**Optimization Strategy:**
- Ask high-value questions first
- Batch related questions together
- Provide context proactively to reduce question count
- Accept uncertainty on low-impact decisions

## Quick Start Guide

### For Developers New to Agentic Coding

1. **Start Here:** Read [What is Context](context/WHAT_IS_CONTEXT.md) and [Why Context Matters](context/WHY_CONTEXT_MATTERS.md)
2. **Then:** Study [Problem Identification First](context-filling-strategies/PROBLEM_IDENTIFICATION_FIRST.md)
3. **Practice:** Use [Clarifying Questions Protocol](context-filling-strategies/CLARIFYING_QUESTIONS_PROTOCOL.md) on next task
4. **Optimize:** Apply [Context Window Optimization](optimization/CONTEXT_WINDOW_OPTIMIZATION.md) patterns

### For Teams Adopting Agentic Coding

1. **Context Standards:** Establish team conventions for context provision
2. **Question Protocols:** Define acceptable question volume and batching rules
3. **Problem Documentation:** Create templates for problem identification
4. **Measurement:** Track time saved vs time spent on context filling

## Research Questions (Work in Progress)

### Context Gap Detection
**Research Question:** Is asking the LLM to find its own context gaps effective, or is there a better strategy?

**Current Hypothesis:**
- LLMs sometimes "pretend" ignorance to prompt clarifying questions
- Other times, genuine knowledge boundaries exist
- Need framework to distinguish genuine gaps from prompt-driven questions

**Investigation Status:** See [Context Gap Investigation](context/CONTEXT_GAP_INVESTIGATION.md)

### Evolving Capabilities
**Research Question:** How do context limits and strategies change as LLMs evolve?

**Tracking Milestones:**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: 200K context window
- Claude Opus 4.1: [capabilities TBD]
- GPT-5: [capabilities TBD]

**Investigation Status:** See [Evolving LLM Capabilities](context/EVOLVING_CAPABILITIES.md)

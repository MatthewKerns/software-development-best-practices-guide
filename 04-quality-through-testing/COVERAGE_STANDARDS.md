# Coverage Standards: Measuring Test Effectiveness

## Overview

Code coverage measures the percentage of your codebase that is executed during testing. While coverage is a useful metric, it's important to understand both its value and its limitations. High coverage doesn't guarantee quality, but low coverage almost certainly indicates inadequate testing.

This guide provides practical standards for test coverage, explains what different coverage metrics mean, and shows how to use coverage data to improve test effectiveness without falling into the "100% coverage" trap.

## Why Coverage Standards Matter

**"Code coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase, but it's a poor tool for assessing test quality."** — Martin Fowler

### The Value of Coverage Metrics

**Gap Detection**: Coverage reveals which code paths are completely untested, highlighting areas that need attention.

**Regression Prevention**: Coverage requirements prevent developers from removing tests or writing new code without tests.

**Refactoring Confidence**: High coverage provides confidence that refactoring won't silently break functionality.

**Team Accountability**: Coverage standards create shared expectations for testing rigor.

### The Limitations of Coverage Metrics

**False Security**: 100% coverage doesn't mean 100% tested. You can execute every line without testing every behavior.

**Quality vs. Quantity**: Coverage measures lines executed, not scenarios validated or edge cases tested.

**Gaming the Metric**: Developers can write meaningless tests just to hit coverage targets.

**Maintenance Cost**: Achieving very high coverage (>95%) often requires extensive mocking and may not improve quality proportionally.

## Source Materials

This guide synthesizes coverage principles from:

- **Code Complete 2** by Steve McConnell (Chapter 22)
  - Incomplete testing
  - Coverage as a minimum bar
- **Clean Code** by Robert C. Martin (Chapter 9)
  - Test quality over coverage quantity
- **Working Effectively with Legacy Code** by Michael Feathers
  - Coverage strategies for existing code

## Coverage Metrics Explained

### Line Coverage (Statement Coverage)

**Definition**: Percentage of code lines executed during tests.

**What It Measures**: Whether each line of code was run at least once.

```python
# Python - Line coverage example
def calculate_discount(price, is_premium):
    discount = 0                    # Line 1 - Always executed
    if is_premium:                  # Line 2 - Always executed
        discount = price * 0.2      # Line 3 - Only if is_premium=True
    return price - discount         # Line 4 - Always executed

# Test achieves 75% line coverage
def test_regular_customer():
    result = calculate_discount(100, False)
    assert result == 100

# Lines executed: 1, 2, 4 (Line 3 not executed)
# Coverage: 3/4 = 75%
```

**Limitations**: Doesn't detect untested branches in boolean expressions.

```python
# Both branches not tested, but line coverage says 100%
def validate(user, session):
    if user and session:  # Only tested with both True
        return True
    return False

# This test achieves 100% line coverage
def test_validate():
    assert validate(User(), Session()) == True
# But never tests: user=None, session=None, or one True/one False
```

### Branch Coverage

**Definition**: Percentage of decision branches (if/else, switch/case) executed during tests.

**What It Measures**: Whether all possible paths through control structures were taken.

```java
// Java - Branch coverage example
public int calculateShipping(int items, boolean isPremium) {
    int shipping = 0;

    if (items > 0) {              // Branch 1: True/False
        shipping = items * 5;
    }

    if (isPremium) {              // Branch 2: True/False
        shipping = shipping / 2;
    }

    return shipping;
}

// Achieving 100% branch coverage requires 4 tests:
@Test public void testMultipleItemsRegular() {
    // Branch 1: True, Branch 2: False
    assertEquals(10, calculateShipping(2, false));
}

@Test public void testMultipleItemsPremium() {
    // Branch 1: True, Branch 2: True
    assertEquals(5, calculateShipping(2, true));
}

@Test public void testZeroItemsRegular() {
    // Branch 1: False, Branch 2: False
    assertEquals(0, calculateShipping(0, false));
}

@Test public void testZeroItemsPremium() {
    // Branch 1: False, Branch 2: True
    assertEquals(0, calculateShipping(0, true));
}
```

**Why It's Better Than Line Coverage**: Catches untested conditional paths.

### Function Coverage

**Definition**: Percentage of functions/methods called during tests.

**What It Measures**: Whether each function was invoked at least once.

```typescript
// TypeScript - Function coverage
class UserService {
  createUser(email: string): User {        // Function 1
    return new User(email);
  }

  deleteUser(id: string): void {           // Function 2
    // Implementation
  }

  updateUser(id: string, data: any): void { // Function 3
    // Implementation
  }
}

// Only testing createUser gives 33% function coverage
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('creates users', () => {
    const service = new UserService();
    const user = service.createUser('test@example.com');
    expect(user.email).toBe('test@example.com');
  });
});

// Functions covered: 1/3 = 33%
```

### Condition Coverage

**Definition**: Percentage of boolean sub-expressions evaluated to both true and false.

**What It Measures**: Whether each condition in complex boolean expressions was tested.

```python
# Python - Condition coverage
def is_eligible(age, income, credit_score):
    # This has 3 conditions (sub-expressions)
    if age >= 18 and income > 50000 and credit_score > 650:
        return True
    return False

# 100% line coverage, but poor condition coverage
def test_eligible_user():
    assert is_eligible(25, 60000, 700) == True
# This only tests: age>=18 (True), income>50000 (True), credit_score>650 (True)

# For 100% condition coverage, need to test each condition as True AND False:
def test_age_too_young():
    assert is_eligible(17, 60000, 700) == False  # age>=18 is False

def test_income_too_low():
    assert is_eligible(25, 40000, 700) == False  # income>50000 is False

def test_credit_too_low():
    assert is_eligible(25, 60000, 600) == False  # credit_score>650 is False

def test_all_conditions_met():
    assert is_eligible(25, 60000, 700) == True   # All True
```

## Recommended Coverage Standards

### By Test Type

Different types of tests have different coverage expectations:

| Test Type | Coverage Target | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Unit Tests** | 85-90% | High coverage expected; dependencies mocked |
| **Integration Tests** | 70-80% | Some paths hard to reach; real dependencies |
| **End-to-End Tests** | 40-60% | Focus on critical paths, not exhaustive coverage |
| **System Tests** | 50-70% | Validate key workflows and integrations |

### By Code Criticality

```python
# Python - Coverage by criticality

# CRITICAL CODE: 100% coverage required
def process_payment(amount, account):
    """Financial transaction - must be thoroughly tested."""
    if amount <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Amount must be positive")
    if account.balance < amount:
        raise InsufficientFundsError()

    account.balance -= amount
    log_transaction(account.id, amount)
    return Transaction(account, amount)

# All paths must be tested: positive amount, negative amount, zero,
# sufficient funds, insufficient funds, transaction logging

# HIGH IMPORTANCE: 90%+ coverage
def calculate_user_permissions(user, resource):
    """Security-related - very important to test thoroughly."""
    # Comprehensive testing required

# MEDIUM IMPORTANCE: 80%+ coverage
def format_user_profile(user):
    """User-facing feature - should be well-tested."""
    # Good coverage expected

# LOW CRITICALITY: 60%+ coverage
def generate_debug_report():
    """Internal tooling - lower coverage acceptable."""
    # Basic testing sufficient
```

### By Code Age

```java
// Java - Coverage standards by code age

// NEW CODE: Strict coverage requirements
// Require 90%+ coverage for all new code
@Test
public void testNewFeature() {
    // All new code should have comprehensive tests
}

// EXISTING CODE (LEGACY): Incremental improvement
// Target: Increase coverage from current baseline by 5% per sprint
// Don't require immediate 90% for large legacy codebases

// REFACTORED CODE: Maintain or improve
// When refactoring, coverage should not decrease
// Aim to improve coverage during refactoring
```

## Practical Coverage Guidelines

### Guideline 1: Coverage Is a Minimum, Not a Goal

**Principle**: Use coverage as a floor (minimum acceptable), not a ceiling (target to reach).

```typescript
// TypeScript - Coverage as a minimum

// BAD: Aiming for exactly 80% coverage
// (Leads to gaming the metric)

// GOOD: Ensuring at least 80% coverage
// (Allows exceeding when beneficial)

// Example CI configuration
{
  "jest": {
    "coverageThreshold": {
      "global": {
        "branches": 80,     // Minimum 80%
        "functions": 80,    // Minimum 80%
        "lines": 80,        // Minimum 80%
        "statements": 80    // Minimum 80%
      }
    }
  }
}

// Actual coverage: 87% - Great! Don't reduce it to meet 80%.
// Actual coverage: 75% - Insufficient! Add more tests.
```

### Guideline 2: 100% Coverage Is Often Not Worth It

**Principle**: Pursuing the last 5-10% of coverage often provides diminishing returns.

```python
# Python - Diminishing returns example

def process_data(data):
    try:
        result = complex_calculation(data)
        log_success(result)
        return result
    except NetworkError as e:
        log_error(e)
        notify_admin(e)
        raise
    except DatabaseError as e:
        log_error(e)
        notify_admin(e)
        rollback_transaction()
        raise
    except ValidationError as e:
        log_error(e)
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        # This catch-all is hard to test comprehensively
        # and may not be worth the effort
        log_error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        raise

# Test main paths: Success, NetworkError, DatabaseError, ValidationError (95%)
# Skip testing: Every possible Exception subclass (would be 100% but low value)
```

**When to accept <100% coverage**:
- Defensive error handling for "impossible" cases
- Framework-generated code (getters/setters)
- Simple delegating methods
- Configuration classes
- Trivial constructors

### Guideline 3: Focus on Uncovered Critical Paths

**Principle**: Prioritize coverage of important code over achieving high overall percentage.

```java
// Java - Prioritize critical code

public class PaymentProcessor {

    // CRITICAL: 100% coverage required
    public PaymentResult processPayment(PaymentRequest request) {
        validateRequest(request);
        authorize(request);
        capture(request);
        recordTransaction(request);
        return new PaymentResult(SUCCESS);
    }

    // CRITICAL: 100% coverage required
    private void validateRequest(PaymentRequest request) {
        if (request.getAmount() <= 0) {
            throw new InvalidAmountException();
        }
        // All validation paths must be tested
    }

    // LESS CRITICAL: 80% coverage acceptable
    private String formatReceiptText(PaymentResult result) {
        // Formatting logic - less critical
        return "Payment of " + result.getAmount() + " processed";
    }

    // LOW PRIORITY: 60% coverage acceptable
    private void logDebugInfo(String message) {
        // Debug logging - least critical
        System.out.println(LocalDateTime.now() + ": " + message);
    }
}
```

### Guideline 4: Test Behavior, Not Just Lines

**Principle**: Coverage should reflect tested behaviors, not just executed code.

```python
# Python - Coverage vs. behavior testing

# HIGH LINE COVERAGE, POOR BEHAVIOR COVERAGE
def test_user_registration_bad():
    user = register_user("test@example.com", "password")
    assert user is not None  # Executes all lines, tests nothing meaningful

# GOOD: Same coverage, better behavior testing
def test_user_registration_good():
    email = "test@example.com"
    password = "SecurePass123!"

    user = register_user(email, password)

    # Test actual behaviors
    assert user.email == email
    assert user.password != password  # Hashed
    assert user.is_active is False  # Requires verification
    assert user.created_at is not None
    assert user.verification_token is not None
```

## Coverage Reporting and Tools

### Coverage Report Analysis

```bash
# Python - pytest coverage report
$ pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Terminal output shows summary
Name                      Stmts   Miss  Cover
---------------------------------------------
src/user_service.py          45      3    93%
src/payment_service.py       60     12    80%
src/email_service.py         30     15    50%  ← Low coverage!
src/utils/formatting.py      20      0   100%
---------------------------------------------
TOTAL                       155     30    81%

# HTML report shows line-by-line coverage
# Open htmlcov/index.html to see which lines are uncovered
```

### Identifying Coverage Gaps

```java
// Java - Using JaCoCo coverage report
/*
Coverage analysis reveals:

1. UserService.java: 95% - Good!
2. PaymentService.java: 78% - Missing edge cases
   - Line 45: Error handling not tested
   - Line 78: Timeout scenario not tested
   - Line 92: Retry logic not tested

3. EmailService.java: 45% - Needs attention
   - Lines 12-35: No tests at all
   - Lines 40-55: Only happy path tested

Action items:
- Add tests for PaymentService edge cases (raise to 85%)
- Add comprehensive EmailService tests (raise to 80%)
*/
```

### Setting Coverage Thresholds

```typescript
// TypeScript - Jest coverage configuration
export default {
  collectCoverage: true,
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 85,
      functions: 85,
      lines: 85,
      statements: 85
    },
    // Higher requirements for critical code
    './src/payment/*.ts': {
      branches: 95,
      functions: 95,
      lines: 95,
      statements: 95
    },
    // Lower requirements for utilities
    './src/utils/*.ts': {
      branches: 75,
      functions: 75,
      lines: 75,
      statements: 75
    }
  },
  coverageReporters: ['html', 'text', 'lcov'],
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    'src/**/*.ts',
    '!src/**/*.d.ts',
    '!src/**/*.spec.ts',
    '!src/index.ts'  // Exclude entry points
  ]
};
```

## Coverage Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Writing Tests Just for Coverage

```python
# Python - BAD: Meaningless test for coverage
def test_user_service_coverage():
    """This test only exists to hit coverage numbers."""
    service = UserService()
    service.create_user("test@example.com")
    service.get_user(1)
    service.delete_user(1)
    # No assertions - just executing code!

# GOOD: Tests that validate behavior
def test_create_user_generates_id():
    service = UserService()
    user = service.create_user("test@example.com")
    assert user.id is not None

def test_get_user_returns_correct_user():
    service = UserService()
    created = service.create_user("test@example.com")
    retrieved = service.get_user(created.id)
    assert retrieved.email == "test@example.com"

def test_delete_user_removes_from_repository():
    service = UserService()
    user = service.create_user("test@example.com")
    service.delete_user(user.id)
    assert service.get_user(user.id) is None
```

### Anti-Pattern 2: Excluding Code to Boost Coverage

```java
// BAD: Excluding code from coverage to meet targets
public class UserService {
    // COVERAGE:OFF - Excluded from coverage
    public void complexMethod() {
        // This method is hard to test, so we just exclude it
        // This defeats the purpose of coverage metrics!
    }
    // COVERAGE:ON

    public void simpleMethod() {
        // Easy to test method
    }
}

// GOOD: Cover the hard code, or mark it for improvement
public class UserService {
    public void complexMethod() {
        // If this is hard to test, it probably needs refactoring
        // Write the tests, then refactor to make it easier
    }

    @Test
    public void testComplexMethod() {
        // Write the difficult test
        // Or break complexMethod into testable pieces
    }
}
```

### Anti-Pattern 3: Mocking Everything for 100% Coverage

```typescript
// BAD: Over-mocking destroys test value
test('order processing', () => {
  const mockValidator = { validate: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(true) };
  const mockPayment = { charge: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({}) };
  const mockInventory = { reserve: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(true) };
  const mockEmail = { send: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({}) };

  const processor = new OrderProcessor(
    mockValidator,
    mockPayment,
    mockInventory,
    mockEmail
  );

  processor.process(order);

  // 100% coverage, but what did we actually test?
  // Just that methods were called in order
  expect(mockValidator.validate).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(mockPayment.charge).toHaveBeenCalled();
});

// GOOD: Use real objects where practical
test('order processing integration', () => {
  const validator = new OrderValidator();           // Real
  const mockPayment = new FakePaymentGateway();     // Fake with behavior
  const inventory = new InMemoryInventory();        // Real
  const mockEmail = { send: jest.fn() };            // Mock only external dependency

  const processor = new OrderProcessor(
    validator,
    mockPayment,
    inventory,
    mockEmail
  );

  processor.process(order);

  // Tests actual behavior, not just method calls
  expect(inventory.isReserved(order.items)).toBe(true);
  expect(mockPayment.getChargedAmount()).toBe(order.total);
});
```

## Coverage Strategy by Project Phase

### Greenfield Projects (New Development)

**Strategy**: Establish high coverage from the start using TDD.

**Standards**:
- Unit tests: 90%+ coverage required
- Integration tests: 80%+ coverage required
- All new code written test-first

**Benefits**: Prevents coverage decay, establishes testing culture.

### Legacy Projects (Existing Code)

**Strategy**: Incremental improvement, focus on changed code.

**Standards**:
- Current coverage: Measure baseline (e.g., 45%)
- New code: 85%+ coverage required
- Modified code: Improve coverage by 5-10%
- Target: Increase overall coverage by 5% per quarter

**Approach**:
```python
# Python - Legacy code coverage strategy

# Step 1: Establish baseline
# Current coverage: 45%

# Step 2: Protect new code
# All new files must have 85%+ coverage

# Step 3: Improve incrementally when touching existing code
def refactor_legacy_function():
    # BEFORE REFACTORING: Add characterization tests
    # - Current coverage: 20%
    # - Add tests to reach 70%+ before refactoring
    # - Refactor with safety net
    # - After refactoring: Maintain 70%+

# Step 4: Measure progress
# Quarter 1: 45% → 50%
# Quarter 2: 50% → 55%
# Quarter 3: 55% → 60%
# Goal: Reach 80% over 12-18 months
```

### Critical Systems (High-Risk)

**Strategy**: Very high coverage with focus on edge cases.

**Standards**:
- Financial code: 95%+ coverage
- Security code: 95%+ coverage
- Safety-critical: 98%+ coverage
- Extensive boundary and error testing

## Integration with Geist Framework

### Ghost: Unknown Coverage Gaps

**Question**: What code paths am I missing?

Use coverage reports to discover untested scenarios:

```python
# Coverage reveals Ghost: Untested error path
def process_transaction(amount):
    if amount > 1000000:  # Line not covered!
        require_manager_approval()
    # Tests never tried amount > 1000000

# Add test for discovered gap
def test_large_transaction_requires_approval():
    with pytest.raises(ApprovalRequiredError):
        process_transaction(1500000)
```

### Geyser: Coverage for Future Changes

**Question**: Will coverage survive refactoring?

Design tests that maintain coverage through changes:
- Test interfaces, not implementations
- Use integration tests for critical paths
- Avoid testing private methods directly

### Gist: Essential Coverage

**Question**: What's essential to cover vs. nice-to-have?

Focus coverage on:
- Business logic (essence of the system)
- Critical paths (payment, security, data integrity)
- Error handling (robustness)

Accept lower coverage for:
- Configuration code
- Simple getters/setters
- Framework glue code

## Summary

Code coverage is a valuable tool when used correctly. Key principles:

1. **Coverage is a minimum, not a goal** - Use as a floor, not a target
2. **Quality over quantity** - Test behaviors, not just lines
3. **Prioritize critical code** - 100% coverage of critical paths matters most
4. **Different standards for different code** - Adjust by risk and criticality
5. **Incremental improvement** - Legacy code improves gradually
6. **Avoid anti-patterns** - Don't game the metric

Recommended standards:
- Unit tests: 85-90%
- Integration tests: 70-80%
- Critical code: 95%+
- New code: High standards from day one
- Legacy code: Incremental improvement

**Remember**: Code coverage reveals what you haven't tested, but doesn't prove what you have tested. Use coverage to find gaps, but focus on writing meaningful tests that validate behavior, handle edge cases, and provide confidence in your code.

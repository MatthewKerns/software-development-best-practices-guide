# Quick Reference: Checklists and Summaries

## Overview

This directory contains condensed, actionable checklists and quick reference guides distilled from the comprehensive guides in other directories. These are designed for quick consultation during development, code review, and problem-solving.

## Why Quick References Matter

While comprehensive guides provide depth and context, developers often need quick answers during active development. Quick references provide:
- Fast lookup during coding
- Code review checklists
- Pre-commit validation
- Decision-making frameworks
- Common pattern references

Without quick references:
- Developers spend time searching comprehensive guides
- Important checks get skipped under time pressure
- Inconsistency across team members
- Best practices are forgotten in the moment

With effective quick references:
- Fast answers during development
- Systematic reviews and checks
- Consistent application of best practices
- Learning reinforcement through repetition

## What Belongs Here

### Quick Reference Criteria
Quick references should be:
- **Actionable**: Checkboxes and specific actions
- **Concise**: One page or less when possible
- **Focused**: One topic or workflow per reference
- **Self-contained**: Usable without reading full guide
- **Referenced**: Link to comprehensive guide for details

### Content Types
- Checklists for common tasks
- Decision trees for common choices
- Pattern catalogs with examples
- Common anti-patterns to avoid
- Metric thresholds and limits
- Command sequences and workflows

## When to Use Quick References

**During Development:**
- Variable naming quick check
- Function design checklist
- Error handling patterns
- Data structure selection

**During Code Review:**
- Code smell checklist
- SOLID principles quick check
- Test coverage validation
- Security review checklist

**Before Commits:**
- Pre-commit validation checklist
- Quality gate verification
- Documentation completeness
- Test execution confirmation

**During Debugging:**
- Debugging workflow checklist
- Common bug patterns
- Root cause analysis framework
- Fix verification steps

# Variable Naming Checklist

Quick validation checklist for variable names. For comprehensive guidance, see [VARIABLE_NAMING.md](../01-foundations/VARIABLE_NAMING.md).

## Quick Checks
- [ ] Name reveals intent without comments
- [ ] Length is 10-16 characters (ideal range)
- [ ] No abbreviations or encodings
- [ ] Pronounceable and searchable
- [ ] Consistent with codebase conventions

## When to Consult Full Guide
- Naming complex domain concepts
- Establishing team conventions
- Resolving naming debates
- Learning naming principles
```

## Quick Start Checklist

When creating a quick reference:
- [ ] Focuses on one specific task or decision
- [ ] Contains actionable checkboxes or steps
- [ ] Links to comprehensive guide
- [ ] Fits on one or two pages maximum
- [ ] Uses clear, simple language
- [ ] Includes decision criteria when relevant

When using a quick reference:
- [ ] Review before starting the task
- [ ] Check off items as you go
- [ ] Consult full guide when uncertain
- [ ] Note any missing items or confusion
- [ ] Suggest improvements based on use

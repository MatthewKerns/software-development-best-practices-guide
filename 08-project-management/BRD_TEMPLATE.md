## Executive Summary

### Business Problem

[Describe in 2-3 sentences the specific problem or opportunity this project addresses. Focus on the pain points, inefficiencies, or gaps in current capabilities.]

**Example:** "Customer support teams currently spend 4+ hours daily manually categorizing and routing incoming support tickets, leading to delayed response times and customer dissatisfaction. This manual process is error-prone and does not scale with our 30% quarterly growth in support volume."

### Proposed Solution

[Provide a high-level description of the solution approach. Focus on WHAT will be built, not HOW it will be implemented technically.]

**Example:** "Implement an AI-powered ticket classification and routing system that automatically categorizes incoming support tickets by topic, urgency, and required expertise, then routes them to the appropriate support team or individual within seconds of submission."

### Business Value

[Quantify the expected return on investment, efficiency gains, cost savings, revenue impact, or strategic benefits. Use specific metrics.]

**Expected Benefits:**
- **Efficiency Gain:** [Quantified improvement, e.g., "Reduce ticket routing time from 4 hours to 30 seconds (99.7% reduction)"]
- **Cost Savings:** [Estimated savings, e.g., "$120K annually in support staff time"]
- **Revenue Impact:** [Expected revenue increase, e.g., "Improve customer retention by 15% through faster response times"]
- **Strategic Value:** [Long-term benefits, e.g., "Enable support team to scale with 50% growth without additional headcount"]

**ROI Calculation:**
- Implementation cost: $[Amount]
- Annual savings: $[Amount]
- Payback period: [Months]

### Effort Estimate

## Risk Assessment

[Identify and assess technical and business risks with mitigation strategies.]

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: [Risk Title]

**Description:**
[Detailed description of the technical risk]

**Probability:** [Low | Medium | High]

**Impact:** [Low | Medium | High]

**Overall Risk Level:** [Low | Medium | High | Critical]

**Risk Level Calculation:**
- **Low**: Probability=Low AND Impact=Low
- **Medium**: Probability=Low/Impact=High OR Probability=High/Impact=Low OR Probability=Medium/Impact=Medium
- **High**: Probability=High AND Impact=High OR Probability=Medium/Impact=High
- **Critical**: Probability=High AND Impact=Critical

**Impact Analysis:**
- [Consequence 1 if risk materializes]
- [Consequence 2 if risk materializes]
- [Consequence 3 if risk materializes]

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. [Proactive action to reduce probability]
2. [Proactive action to reduce impact]
3. [Contingency plan if risk occurs]

**Mitigation Owner:** [Person responsible for mitigation]

**Risk Status:** [Open | Mitigated | Closed | Accepted]

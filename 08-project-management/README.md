# Project Management: Planning and Organization

## Overview

This directory contains guides on project planning, organization, documentation practices, and development workflow management. These guides help teams plan effectively, track progress, and maintain organized codebases and documentation.

## Why These Practices Matter

Good project management practices enable technical excellence. Without effective planning and organization:
- Requirements are unclear or missing
- Progress is invisible until problems emerge
- Documentation becomes outdated and useless
- Dependencies and risks go unmanaged
- Teams work inefficiently and inconsistently

With strong project management:
- Requirements are clear and testable
- Progress and blockers are visible
- Documentation stays useful and current
- Dependencies and risks are managed proactively
- Teams work efficiently with clear priorities

## Source Materials

These guides draw from:

- **Code Complete 2** by Steve McConnell (Chapters 3-4, 27-28, 32)
  - Upstream prerequisites
  - Requirements gathering
  - Architecture prerequisites
  - Project planning and tracking
  - Configuration management

- **Clean Code** by Robert C. Martin (Chapters 1, 13)
  - Professional practices
  - Team agreements and standards

- **Agile and Lean principles**
  - Iterative development
  - Continuous delivery
  - Adaptive planning

## When to Use These Guides

## Key Principles

### Effective Requirements
- **Specific**: Clear, testable acceptance criteria
- **Documented**: Written down and version controlled
- **Validated**: Reviewed by stakeholders and implementers
- **Prioritized**: Essential vs. nice-to-have is clear
- **Stable**: Changes are managed and tracked

### Planning Best Practices
- **Iterative**: Plan in waves (high-level â†’ detailed)
- **Realistic**: Based on team velocity and capacity
- **Visible**: Progress and blockers are transparent
- **Adaptive**: Plans adjust based on learning
- **Minimal**: Just enough planning to proceed confidently

### Documentation Standards
- **Useful**: Serves actual reader needs
- **Current**: Kept up-to-date with changes
- **Discoverable**: Easy to find when needed
- **Concise**: Essential information only
- **Maintained**: Ownership and review process

### Issue Tracking
- **Clear**: Title and description are understandable
- **Complete**: All necessary context is provided
- **Linked**: Related issues and PRs are connected
- **Tracked**: Status and progress are visible
- **Closed**: Completed work is marked done
